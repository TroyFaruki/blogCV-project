  <p>I am a Southern California based Software Developer with an Information Security background. My passion for programming
  began with the study of object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C#. This led me to self-study front-end, full-stack
  development, Linux, AWS/Azure Cloud Computing, and DevOps. While I was in college I studied off an e-learning platform
  called Udacity and have many of my projects for each course I took on my github profile. I have designed web applications, private servers, and virtualized infrastructure(VmWare ESXI and VSphere) I
  have a professional and academic background in Business Administration. I worked part-time as I went through college in
  an IT/Customer service facing role. As the years flew by, I developed a passion for studying humans and the way they
  interact with technology. By default I choose a technology-oriented track for my business degree to supplement my
  passion for software & cloud systems development. The tracks I selected were Computer Information Systems w/emphasis in Cybersecurity and Forensics and
  eBusiness w/emphasis in eBusiness Technology. Some other subjects I delved deeper into were Philosophy, Economics, and
  Social Behavioral Sciences. I also learned secure web programming for the following languages C#, PHP, and Python. As well as
  a knowledge base of the Red hat kali linux OS. One of my life goals is to enter into a company and pursue a position in developer operations.
